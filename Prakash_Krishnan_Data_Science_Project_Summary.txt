Research Design Project: 

The African elephant is the largest animal walking the Earth. Numbering three to five million in the last century, African elephant populations were severely reduced to their current levels because of hunting. The purpose of this study is to utilize the predictive power of using NDVI data to determine the movement of elephants to develop strategic insights for elephant conservation, reduce animal-human conflicts and improve ecological balance.Links to Report
